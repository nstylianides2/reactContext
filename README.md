# Intro
This project is a REACT project to create a reactive form. It uses Webpack for compilation into vanilla JS.\
It also uses the _react-hook-form_ for form creation and _@mui/material_ for UX.

# Deps
Do read documentation of React at: https://react.dev/learn

# Tricky things with REACT
1. Component based development (USE ONLY FUNCTIONAL components and Hooks)
2. Hooks
3. State
4. Router (but this is trivial now)

# Install
npm init

# Dev
1. You can just run it and webpack will do dynamic building while you change files
   1. ```npm run start```
2. You can build it in a bundle.js
   1. ```npm run build```. And get ```bundle.js``` in ```dist``` folder
